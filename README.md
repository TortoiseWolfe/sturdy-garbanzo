Yes, there are several Docker images available for setting up an Anaconda-based development environment. Here are some options:

1. **Official Anaconda Docker Image:**
   - There's an official Docker image provided by Continuum Analytics on Docker Hub. This image has Anaconda pre-installed and ready to use, with the Anaconda distribution installed in the `/opt/conda` folder, ensuring the `conda` command is available in the default user's path【18†(source)】.

2. **Anaconda and Miniconda Docker Images by Anaconda, Inc.:**
   - Anaconda, Inc. provides both Anaconda and Miniconda Docker images which can be found in their documentation. These images can serve as a base for your development environment, especially if you are integrating with other tools or frameworks【19†(source)】.

3. **Anaconda Development Container Images by Microsoft:**
   - Microsoft also provides pre-built Anaconda Development Container Images on Docker Hub. You can reference these images directly in your Docker configuration files, or update the `FROM` statement in your own Dockerfile to use these images as a base. An example Dockerfile is included in the repository, which might be helpful as a reference【20†(source)】.

4. **Open Source Version of Anaconda on Docker Hub:**
   - There is also an open-source version of Anaconda available on Docker Hub provided by Continuum Analytics, Inc. This version includes over 100 of the most popular Python packages for data science and provides access to over 720 Python and R packages that can be easily installed using the `conda` dependency manager【21†(source)】.

```bash
# Create a blank docker-compose.yml file in the project root directory and populate it with the necessary content
echo -e "version: '3'\n\
services:\n\
  autogen-service:\n\
    build:\n\
      context: .  # Updated context to project root directory\n\
      dockerfile: docker/Dockerfile  # Updated path to Dockerfile\n\
    volumes:\n\
      - ./autogen:/autogen\n\
      - ./src:/src\n\
    command: /bin/bash -c \"autogen -T autogen/templates/template.tpl autogen/definitions/definitions.def\"" > docker-compose.yml
```
You can choose any of these images based on your project requirements and the level of customization or control you need over the environment. Once you've chosen an image, you can use it as the base image in your Dockerfile, and then add any additional setup or configuration needed for your project.
